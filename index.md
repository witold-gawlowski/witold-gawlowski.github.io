My name is Witold Gawlowski, I am a game programmer. Welcome to my personal webpage.

I am currently studying Game Engineering course at Goldsmiths, University of London. I will be graduating this April and looking for internship or job opportunity from then on.

I am interested in graphics, engine or tools programming positions.
I am also a big fan of Unity Engine.

Have a look at my projects [here](/projects.html).

My name is Witold Gawlowski, I am a game programmer. Welcome to my personal webpage.

I am currently studying Game Engineering course at Goldsmith, University of London. I will be graduating this April and will be looking for internship or job opportunity from then on.  
I would prefer working closely with Technical Artists but I feel I would be also a string physics, engine or tools programmer. I am also interested in Unity programmer positions.

Have a look at my projects [here](/projects.html).

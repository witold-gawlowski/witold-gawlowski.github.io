My name is Witold Gawłowski.

I am studying the final year of Game Engineering MSc. Before moving to London last summer, I got Bachelor Degrees from Physics and CS in Krakow, Poland.

The games I like include: Shadow of Colossus, Dungeon Keeper, Terraria, Dota and Starcraft but also poker, basketball and ultimate frisbee.

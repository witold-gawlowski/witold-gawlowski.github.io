My name is Witold Gawlowski, I am a game programmer. Welcome to my personal webpage.

I will be graduating from Goldsmith's University, Game Engineering MSc this April and will be looking for internship or job opportunity from then on.  
I would prefer working closely with Technical Artists but I am also interested in physics, engine or tools programming.  

Have a look at my projects [here](/projects.html).

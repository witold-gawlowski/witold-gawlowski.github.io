King of the hill game, developed over 48 hours by a team of 5 people:
Robert Doig
Nickita Veselov
Pablo Laneras Henriquez
Matthew Duddington
and me.

I was a technical lead in this project. I have also implemented dynamic water mesh. Currently the project is in process of further development and we plan to release it on the Steam platform.

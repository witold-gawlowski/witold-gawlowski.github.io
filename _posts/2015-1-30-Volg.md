Game is available to play on-line: [link](/volg/volgD.html).

How to play:  
The game is designed to be played by two players on one keyboard. Steering is WSAD for Player 1 and ARROWS for Player 2. The aim is to blend into the crowd of dancing NPC's. If any player spots the other one he hits SPACE and get a point for clicking on the opponent's sprite.



It was created during 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2015 with Jakub Pabis and Nina Sosenko. The theme of the Game Jam was "Ritual". It got us 9th place in local competition.

Fun facts:  
Our team have met just before the competition.  
We all did not know about the hidden in plain sight genre at that point.  
I have learned JavaScript during the competition.

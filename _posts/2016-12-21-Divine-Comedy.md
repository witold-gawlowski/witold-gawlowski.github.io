Curently in development.

Features that I am responsible for:

* Integration of c++ code and blueprints.
* Dynamic pitch axis: it gets angled when player is falling down.
* Procedural cave geneation using Convay's game of life. Based on [this](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664) article but we have generalized it to 3D.

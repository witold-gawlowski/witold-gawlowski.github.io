King of the hill game, developed over 48 hours by a team of 5 people:  
* Robert Doig,  
* Matthew Duddington,  
* Pablo Laneras Henriquez,  
* Nickita Veselov,  
and me.

I was a technical lead in this project. I have also implemented dynamic water mesh. Currently the project is in process of further development and we plan to release it on the Steam platform.  

You may download and play the game jam version of the game [here](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/storm).

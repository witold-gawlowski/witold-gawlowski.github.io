A game developed during Slavic Game Jam with a team of people met on the spot: [Magdalena Bliźniuk](https://www.artstation.com/artist/paxnamra) and [Bartek Szczygło](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g3hlrWVJkw).
I was the lead programmer and also created one music piece(0:11 in the clip above). The game is also available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SGJ2016.SuperTamagotchiBros).
